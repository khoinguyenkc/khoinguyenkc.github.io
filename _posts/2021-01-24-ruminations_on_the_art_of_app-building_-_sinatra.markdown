Building this sinatra app was a whole new world. It made me realize scale changes everything. The complexity and time increases non-linearly, and thus it's more important than ever to use good practices like the separation of concerns and keeping things at the smallest possible unit. When I had to debug problems, I was so glad my methods weren't convoluted so I can quickly pinpoint the source of the bug. There's no doubt it would've been much, much more difficult to think clearly if my code was convoluted an dense and I have to keep tabs in my head. The planning of the  MVC architecture was a huge time saver. 

While all these good practices are wonderful, they don't change the fact that there will be moments, many moments, when you feel overwhelmed, because you don't know how to start. And my solution every time was the same: Write it down in words what you want. Break it down further. This is basically the Feynman technique. Instead of thinking there's so many things you don't know, focus on what you do know. From there, figure out what else you know. Just move forward. Don't get stuck. Do something. Do something. Do something. Articulate the problem in writing. Work backward from what you want to the code that delivers it. The only way out is through. Keep doing this and you'll eventually get more comfortable. It'll never be easy but it will be less intimidating. This is also what I did in the command line app, but here I have to do it much more frequently and aggressively. And I think I've gotten so much better because of it. 

And here is another meta topic. When coding, I also often wondered if this way of doing is a good way. And that's when I realized the importance of knowing many coding patterns, not just seeing them, but internalizing them. Only then they will become a tool in your kit. There's the saying if you've only got a hammer, everything you see is a nail. The goal here is to collect many tools so that you will choose the best tool for the job. The MVC and separation-of-concern and TDD and D-R-Y were all life-changing. If I learned more of these, it would make me infinitely better.

One thing I should do better is to not underrestimate the time it takes to complete. I added a pessimistic margin of error, but that was still not enough. I underrestimate how long it takes to do the CSS. Also, I did not have a design in mind before doing the CSS, so it was very muddled. I keep changing the design. This violates the separation of concern principle. And it wasted time. 

I would descibe the process of getting a project to the finish line as sailing a ship. There are obviously guidelines and principles, but there is no concrete formula. You move forward and reorient and adjust at every step. Each project is different, just as each sail is different. The weather conditions will never be the same. No one knows the precise way, but keep moving forward and you'll get there.
