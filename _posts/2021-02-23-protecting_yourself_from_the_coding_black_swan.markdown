For the Rails project, I built an e-commerce site. I've always wanted to do it because there is a sense of legetimacy that comes with it. Everyone is familiar with ecommerce web apps, and I think they get a pretty good sense of the complexity it entails. And complex it was. This complexity has taught me many lessons. 

The number one take away is that I should have spent more time in the planning process. I was very excited to dive into it, and also I was under the delusion that I knew my app very well. It turns out knowing what you want doesn't really mean you know how to get there. 

The checkout flow is a neglected piece of the ecommerce store, since it is rather uninteresting. I didn't do the planning for this part of the app, assuming it is not that complicated. Little did I know, there is an intricate machinery behind it. I only knew when I actually got there. It turned out this little part of the app, where the user spend less than a minute, takes up the majority of my coding time. 

 And failing to draw out the circuitry makes it much harder.  You do somethign and then you realize you need to do one more thng, then another thing, then another thing. It doesn't just take more time, it is also causing unneccessary frustration. Uncertainty is part of the process, certainly, but this kind of uncertainty was avoidable. 
 
It is tempting to take the shortcut instead of following good practices, but these practices are there for a reason. They are a kind of insurance to limit the impact of unfortunate events.  To prevent exponential time delays. Or to use a certain kind of jargon, to clip your left tail risks. Protecting yourself against the "black swan event". I applied this idea pretty much everywhere, but somehow I didn't apply it to software development. That is highly ironic, as software development is notorious for massive time delays. It was a humbling experience.

I also underestimated how long it takes to do the css styling. I did make them very reusable and systematic, but there was one spot that I could've done better. I should've planned the design ahead of css excution. That is, in a way, separation of concern. I bought into the "design in the browser" idea, but I think that doesn't work if you are obsessing over details. It's much easier to drag things around in phtooshop to calibrate things than in css code. 

Sometimes you gotta get burned to learn not to touch the fire. I've only reach these insights in hindsight. In the moment, I was just trying to get through the challenge.  This project was not smooth sailing by any stretch but if there was a silver lining,  I guess it forced me to rise up to the challenge. And rose I did. I feel much, much more comfortable with problem-solving. One problem after another flies in your face, and you just tackle them one at a time. It's Dory's "Just keep swimming" mindset. I am very pleased with  the final product. It's gorgeous and hyper-realistic. Next time, though, I'll err on the side of too much planning.
