This was my first time building an app without clear specifcations, so I learned a lot.

One really cool thing was seeing the wonders of this one little idea - just build fake content of what you want to happen, then start making it real. It's almost like a reverse process, as opposed to starting from scratch. Here you start at the end and start fleshing things out from there. It is surprisingly much more intuitive this way. Helps you get unstuck and make progress. It's hard to explain, you just have to try it yourself to see it. Simple idea, big impact.

Another thing I learned was to do the dirty work first. That means set up everything, and by everything, I really mean everything. Hook all the files together, make sure the app is running, and go even further than that to test publish it. I made the mistake of making it run but not knowing how to publish it. I thought I was close to being done but boy was I wrong. Running things in the terminal will always be a nightmare, it's just trial and error, a blind search in the dark where even if you get there you still have no idea why. But thats exactly why we need to do this first, when we have the most patience and tolerance for terminal nonsense. Eat the frog, so to speak. 

Also, get in the habit of testing very often. Make testing efficient by printing outr variables in the step of a flow, so you know that each variable is what you expect it to be. Keep them there even if things are working, because they might work now, but in the future it might break. This makes debugging so much more efficient. 

I realized coding is about having discipline. Without it, you'll pay a much bigger price later. Everybody wants to get to the fun part, the interesting part, but you have to embrace the mundane as well. 

Overall, this was a humbling experience. It takes more effort than I estimated, but I learned a ton. Doing things from scratch is always much harder. This is when the training wheels come off and you really assess yourself.
